Stuff to do:

    fix console scroll code
    
    lock page directory when using vm_write
    
    do condvars need state?
    switch atomic functions to disable_interrupts?
    
    readline
        keep two buffers, scancodes and chars
        process only if readline is active
        disable interrupts
    
    clean up header files
    move common.h functions into appropriate files

    error handling
        1. recoverable fault -> fix the problem
        2. inform the user -> kill the thread / process
        3. kill the kernel
        
        check for failure case in malloc calls
        init/install should panic instead of returning errors
    
    sleep
        switch to linked list variant
        
    tests to write
        readline multithreaded
        print multithreaded

    allocation still doesn't count frames
    
CURRENT:
    1. finalize_exit and exec
    2. rollforward sleep implementation
    3. rollforward mutex implementation
