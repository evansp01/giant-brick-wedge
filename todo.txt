Stuff to do:

    doxygen cleanup

    fix write_vm
    void * to uint32_t where we might do math
    
Stuff to do for checkpoint 2:
    
    disable interrupts vs disable context switching
    
    locking
        mutexes
        process locks
        thread locks
        scheduler lock (flag)
        frame alloc lock
        process lock for page fault handler / lock the page table & set lock bit
        cond vars without malloc (linked lists using sleeping threads' memory)
        
    exec system call
        fix how argc, argv works (work towards exec system call)
        validity check for given values from user for system calls
        copy user input into kernel space
        validate user input
        replace the currently running program (similar to loader code)
    
    fork system call
        copy software exception handler
        
    scheduler
        runnable queue
            things are added when marked runnable
        make_runnable should not be preemptible
            disable interrupts across make_runnable
        yield() does not affect scheduling
