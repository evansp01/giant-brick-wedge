Things to take note of:
    error handling
        1. recoverable fault -> fix the problem
        2. inform the user -> kill the thread / process
        3. kill the kernel

Stuff to do:
    exec strlen should fail fast
    copy to p3ck3, give status update
    //strange bug: schedule() called with conflicting thread status
    
Testing:
    add and run remaining tests
    run cho_variant at varying timer rates (right now 100-120 done)
    copy user tests into user/progs
    run user tests
    write tests
        readline multithreaded
        print multithreaded
        readfile
        ...
    
Non-code:
    clean up header files --> move to local headers
    
    change lprintf to also printf to console (define print macro)
    doxygen
    design docs
        
    
Optimizations:
    use fast mutexes
    change print, cursor implementation (put all bytes then set cursor)
    switch to hash tables for global thread/process lists
