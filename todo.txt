Stuff to do:

    fault handler error codes on stack
    use write_vm
    fix how argc, argv works (work towards exec system call)
    void * to uint32_t where we might do math
    doxygen for everything
    
    pid/tid numbering scheme
    
Stuff to do for checkpoint 2:
    
    disable interrupts vs disable context switching
    mutexes
    cond vars without malloc (linked lists using sleeping threads' memory)
    validity check for given values from user for system calls
    kernel versions of system calls (yield, etc)
    
    context switch
        adjust VM stuff after switching
    
    locking
        process locks
        thread locks
        scheduler lock (flag)
        frame alloc lock
        process lock for page fault handler / lock the page table & set lock bit
        
    exec system call
        copy user input into kernel space
        validate user input
        replace the currently running program (similar to loader code)
    
    fork system call
        assume only a single thread in the process
        copy page tables
