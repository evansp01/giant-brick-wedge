Stuff to do:
    move stuff out of kernel.c
    generalize fault and system call handlers
        iret & popa structs
        single exception handlers for useless faults
        handler error codes
        fix gettid
    access tcbs/pcbs through an interface
    doxygen for everything
    use write_vm
    fix how argc, argv works (work towards exec system call)
    void * to uint32_t where we might do math
