Testing:
    write tests
        readline multithreaded
        print multithreaded
        user code tries to schedule descheduled/sleeping kernel threads
            sleep - make_runnable
            fork - make_runnable(tid), make_runnable(tid+1)
        spawn many threads and do make_runnable, FOR: compare LL and hash table
        new pages
        hash table tests
   
Non-code:
    error return to user
    
End game:
    re-run ALL test
        + cho_variant at slow
        + chow at slow for a short amount of time
    re-read code
    re-read design docs
    review config.mk
