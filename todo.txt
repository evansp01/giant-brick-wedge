Testing:
    run cho_variant at varying timer rates (right now 100-125 done)
    write tests
        readline multithreaded
        print multithreaded
        ...
    
Non-code:
    clean up header files --> move to local headers
    re-read code
    change lprintf to also printf to console (define print macro)
    doxygen
    design docs
        
    
Optimizations:
    use fast mutexes
    switch to hash tables for global thread/process lists
