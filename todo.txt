Stuff to do:

    fix console scroll code
    
    lock page directory when using vm_write
    
    mutex change to resemble semaphore and use disable interrupts
        no aimless spinwait yield loops
            1. Change mutexes
            2. Change cond variables
            3. Change semaphore usages (replace with mutexes)
    
    readline
        keep two buffers, scancodes and chars
        process only if readline is active
        disable interrupts
    
    clean up header files
    move common.h functions into appropriate files

    error handling
        1. recoverable fault -> fix the problem
        2. inform the user -> kill the thread / process
        3. kill the kernel
        
        check for failure case in malloc calls
        init/install should panic instead of returning errors
    
    sleep
        switch to linked list variant
        
    tests to write
        readline multithreaded
        print multithreaded

    allocation still doesn't count frames
