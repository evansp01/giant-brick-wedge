Testing:
    write tests
        readline multithreaded
        print multithreaded
        user code tries to schedule descheduled/sleeping kernel threads
        ...
   
Non-code:
    change lprintf to also printf to console (define print macro)
    
Optimizations:
    switch to hash tables for global thread/process lists
    console pre-shell printout
    
End game:
    re-read code
