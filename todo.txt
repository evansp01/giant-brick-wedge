Things to take note of:
    error handling
        1. recoverable fault -> fix the problem
        2. inform the user -> kill the thread / process
        3. kill the kernel

Stuff to do:
    
    clean up header files --> move to local headers
    
    exec strlen should fail fast
    
    switch to hash tables for global thread/process lists
    
    change lprintf to also printf to console (non-simics functionality)
    
    change print, cursor implementation (put all bytes then set cursor)
    
    run all tests
    
    readline
        keep two buffers, scancodes and chars
        process only if readline is active
        disable interrupts
    
    tests to write
        readline multithreaded
        print multithreaded
        readfile
    
    use fast mutexes
