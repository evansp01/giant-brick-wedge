Things to take note of:
    error handling
        1. recoverable fault -> fix the problem
        2. inform the user -> kill the thread / process
        3. kill the kernel

Stuff to do:
    exec strlen should fail fast
    copy to p3ck3, give status update
    strange bug: schedule() called with conflicting thread status
    
Testing:
    re-run all kernel tests
    copy user tests into user/progs
    run user tests
    write tests
        readline multithreaded
        print multithreaded
        readfile
    
Non-code:
    get rid of all TODO, useless code
    organize files/folders
    change lprintf to also printf to console (define print macro)
    clean up header files --> move to local headers
    doxygen
    design docs
    
Optimizations:
    use fast mutexes
    change print, cursor implementation (put all bytes then set cursor)
    switch to hash tables for global thread/process lists
    readline
        keep two buffers, scancodes and chars
        process only if readline is active
        disable interrupts
